A major design goal of this application is simplicity. Everyone should be able to merge two or more PDF-files.

## Features

- Merge PDFs

## Roadmap

- Select output folder and filename (currently ~/Desktop/output.pdf)
- Select pages to merge in the sidebar (this would technically enable PDF splitting)
- Switch to iText v7
